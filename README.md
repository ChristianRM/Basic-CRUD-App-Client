# Basic CRUD APP
This application was developed as culminating project of the web development course that I taught. The main objective was to put into practice the knowledge of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND NON-RELATIONAL DATABASES while employing a popular web development stack, MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue, Node).

The app itself is a list of people with profile picture, this app has the capability of adding new people, update or delete their information. The students were shown different HTTP methods and their use cases.
